- **Error Handling:** Added `isDatabaseConnected` flag and detailed error messages
- **Middleware:** Added `checkDatabaseConnection` to all API routes
- **Status Endpoint:** Added `/api/status` for database health monitoring
- **Common MySQL Errors:** Added specific handling for connection issues

### Phase 4: Invoice Creation Fixes
**User Request:** "what is this error while running why this is occured and after creation of invoice new invoice should be generate as per the add shipment form right why are you showing default invoce at creation there will be new invoice should form"

**Issues Fixed:**

### Phase 8: Number Formatting & Calculations
**User Request:** "look like this image will be the calculation should be like this and amount figure will be til round till 2 digits and like this will be invoice so for our software should be like this only"

**Changes Made:**

### Phase 10: Billing Structure Implementation
**User Request:** "Inbound and Outbound sections with their categories ‚Üí sub-categories ‚Üí sub-sub-categories, and then present a clean, structured content summary (A, B, C ‚Ä¶ style) so that you can use it for new changes in add shipment"

customers (id, company_name, contact_person, email, phone, address, created_at)
shipments (id, customer_id, shipment_type, shipment_subtype, po_reference, slb_reference, 
           reverse_charge, created_by, created_at)
invoices (id, shipment_id, invoice_no, invoice_date, due_date, status, total_usd, 
          total_inr, created_by, created_at)
invoice_items (id, invoice_id, description, quantity, rate_usd, rate_inr, 
               amount_usd, amount_inr, created_at)
```

## Setup Instructions for New Environment

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Create database
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE accex_shipment_db;
USE accex_shipment_db;
SOURCE accex_shipment_database.sql;
```

### 2. Application Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start application
npm start
```

### 3. Default Login Credentials
- **Admin:** admin@accex.com / admin123
- **Manager:** manager@accex.com / manager123
- **User1:** user1@accex.com / user123
- **User2:** user2@accex.com / user123

## Important Notes for Continuity

1. **Database Credentials:** Always use `accex_shipment_db` as database name
2. **Session Management:** Ensure `credentials: 'include'` in fetch requests
3. **Number Formatting:** Always use `.toFixed(2)` for currency display
4. **Error Handling:** Check database connection before API operations
5. **Git Workflow:** Avoid committing `node_modules/` directory

## Future Development Considerations

1. **Billing Structure:** The cascading dropdowns are ready for price/rate integration
2. **Invoice Templates:** Current structure can be extended for multiple templates
3. **User Permissions:** Role-based access control can be enhanced
4. **Reporting:** Dashboard statistics can be expanded
5. **Export Features:** PDF generation can be added
